## Palindrome Number-9


Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

### Java solution 


```public boolean isPalindrome(int num){
   if(num < 0) return  false; 
   int reversed = 0, remainder, original = num;
   while(num != 0) {
        remainder = num % 10; // reversed integer is stored in variable
        reversed = reversed * 10 + remainder; //multiply reversed by 10 then add the remainder so it gets stored at next decimal place.
        num  /= 10;  //the last digit is removed from num after division by 10.
    }
    // palindrome if original and reversed are equal
    return original == reversed;
}```
